# Sherman-Generators
Just some little programs for making pixel-chickens.

'Custom.exe' allows you to customize the color of every layer\n
'Random.exe' just makes random shermans every time you hit the 'Generate' button\n\n

'Custom.py' and 'Random.py' are just the python versions of the programs. Not really useful unless you have python installed.
